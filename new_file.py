# This is a very long and detailed code to print a simple message
# We will start by defining a function that does nothing

def do_nothing():
    pass

# Now we will define another function that calls the do_nothing function
def call_do_nothing():
    do_nothing()

# Let's call the call_do_nothing function
call_do_nothing()

# Finally, we will print the message
# This is the main part of our code
# We are using the print function to display a message on the console
# The message we are going to print is "nothing is here"
# This is a very important message
# We need to make sure it is printed correctly
# So let's go ahead and print it

print("nothing is here")

# End of the code
# We have successfully printed the message
# Congratulations!
